# Core dependencies for Binance ML Training Platform
# Versions chosen for compatibility with the current environment (TensorFlow 2.20.0 + bundled Keras)

# YAML and utilities
pyyaml==6.0.2
termcolor==2.4.0
requests==2.32.3

# MLFlow for experiment tracking
mlflow==2.16.0

# TensorFlow + Keras (GPU/CPU variant can be adjusted if needed)
# For your current environment (macOS arm, Python 3.13), pip reports TensorFlow 2.20.0
# as the available version, so we pin to that here. This uses tf.keras bundled with
# TensorFlow and does not install the standalone keras package.
tensorflow==2.20.0

# Optional: if you later use numpy/pandas explicitly, they will be pulled in by TF/MLflow,
# but you can pin them here if you want deterministic versions.
# numpy==1.26.4
# pandas==2.2.2
